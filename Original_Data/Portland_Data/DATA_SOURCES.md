Data on Portland CSOs was received in e-mails from Denis Welch, of
Portland Water District, sent to Curtis C. Bohlen.

Dennis sends monthly summaries of CSO activity to a list of water quality
stakeholders, including CBEP.

December reports each year contain data for the previous 12 months, providing a
convenient annual summary.
 
In some cases, (e.e., 2015 data) these results have not been certified as "FINAL",
but they are thought to be correct.

Portland CSO Data came from from e-mails from Dennis Welch, of PWD, sent

*  1/11/2016,  
*  3/2/2017,   
*  1/26/2018,   
*  1/30/2019,
*  10/01/2020.

2016, 2017, and 2018 data were in CCB e-mail archives, under
"Nutrients and water quality / CSOs". Apparently, older e-mails are
automatically deleted from GMail. The 2015 e-mail is no longer accessible.
The 2015 data was retreived from archives of data analysis related to preparing
the Nutrient Council report several years ago.

A request for the complete 2019 data was sent to Denis Welch on September 30, 2020.
He responded October 1, 2020 with the 2019 files, in two separate e-mails.

E-mails contain both CSO volume and rainfall data, in excel spreadsheets.

Notice that the data from 2015 uses a slightly different data format.  It is
structured with a row for each DAY within events.  All other data sheets have a
row for each EVENT, with a start date and an end date.
